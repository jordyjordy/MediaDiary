# Mediadiary App

The mediadiary app was developed for a survey to investigate the use of an application to record daily entries in regards to social media posts.

The app was developed for a research at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam using Vuejs for the frontend, and express + postgeSQL for the backend.
